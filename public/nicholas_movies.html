<hr />
<h3>Scott Pilgrim</h3>
<P>This is the first movie me and my wife watched together. It additionally is a great film highlighting importance of self respect.</P>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>This movie while showing the plight of multi personality disorder, shows how your demenor and attitude can effect your world. The shy introverted main character is going no where and no one ever listens to him. However his alterior self who takes charge and is confident is a cult of personality.</p>
<h3>Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>This movie is the pinicale of superhero movies. It follows miles coming into his powers, but shows the contrast of the seasoned spiderman who is at a low point. They relationship helps one to grow while the other learns of his own short comings.</p>
